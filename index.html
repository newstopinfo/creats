                                            however, Clearwater Cave System is more than just its longest member. Discovered in the late 1970s, the cave system exists within Gunung Mulu National Park which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>In the Clearwater Cave System, you’ll find an underground river, as well as a plethora of unique rock formations. Containing an exceptionally large passage, the Clearwater Cave System is the longest of its
                                            kind in Southeast Asia and serves as a major tourist attraction. The amazing thing about caves is that nobody knows their true size. Sure, Clearwater may rank last, but it is still being explored until this
                                            very day.

                Cave comes from the colorful crystals that can be found adorning the inner corners of the cave.
                <br>
                <br>There are a number of tours you can take to truly experience Jewel Cave in all its splendor, whether you want to trek to the cave system underground or enjoy the trails on the land above ground.
